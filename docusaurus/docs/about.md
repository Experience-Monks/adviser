## Say hello to Adviser

While linters have become one of the most essential tools for code quality checks there's not one linter that manages to cover all aspects of a project's lifecyle. At Jam3 we needed a more robust linter that could cover other aspects of project development too. With these ideas in mind we created Adviser - an extendable linter.

## How does it work?

Adviser is a CLI that can be integrated with npm, and it runs tasks across plugins defined in a configuration file. Each plugin defines rules for the linter to run and may include hooks and settings. Each rule includes a severity used to report the issues and may have options.

## Future

Advisor has already become an integral part of our development process at Jam3. We are very excited about the potential this linter has and we'd love to see how this tool helps other developers maintain a high quality code standard across their projects too.
