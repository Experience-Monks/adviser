Adviser includes by default some built in rules, we are working on adding more.

The current list of built-in rules is:

- `package-json-properties`: Includes options to restrict and blacklist properties on the package.json
- `root-files`: Includes options to restrict and blacklist files on the root directory.

All the rules documentation is located inside [/docs/rules](https://github.com/Jam3/adviser/tree/master/docs/rules)
