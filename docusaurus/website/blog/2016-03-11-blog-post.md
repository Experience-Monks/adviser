Thanks to one of the designers at Jam3, [Pedro Barroso](https://twitter.com/pedrohsbarroso), Adviser now has a logo and an identity. Added we are happy to announce the first version of the documentation; the API is growing and the need to document features is here.

Check out the new logo in the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/jam3/adviser).
