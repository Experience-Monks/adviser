## Installation

```
npm install -g adviser
```

## Usage

Adviser's goal is to run rules defined in a configuration file. It doesn't get involve in what the rules do; it just run them and control them.

In order to use it, you need to:

1. Create a configuration file
2. (Optional) Install the plugins you've like to use
3. Set the rules we want to use

### Run adviser

`$ adviser`

If you run adviser without any arguments it will try to find a valid configuration file in the current directory and continues in through the parent directories until find a configuration file.

### CLI Arguments

`-c, --config` Specify config file path

`--init` Run config initialization wizard

`--debug` Output debugging information

`--verbose` Display extra information

`-t, --tags` Run rules that match tags

`-h, --help` Show help

`-v, --version` Output the version number

### Configuration example file

```
{
  "plugins": ["plugin1", "plugin2"],
  "rules": {
    "plugin1/exampleWarnRule": "warn",
    "plugin1/exampleErrorRule": "error",
    "plugin1/exampleOffRule": "off",
    "plugin2/exampleNumberWarnRule": 1,
    "plugin2/exampleNumberErrorRule": 2,
    "plugin2/exampleNumberOffRule": 0,
    "plugin2/exampleFullWarnRule": ["warn", {options: 'options'}],
    "plugin2/exampleFullErrorRule": ["error", {name: 'plugin'}],
    "plugin2/exampleFullNumberWarnRule": [1, {name: 2}],
    "plugin2/exampleFullNumberErrorRule": [2, {}]
  }
}
```

## Built in rules

All the rules documentation is located inside `/docs/rules`

_Rules_:

- package-json-properties: Includes options to restrict and blacklist properties on the package.json
- root-files: Includes options to restrict and blacklist files on the root directory.

## Release

To releasing new versions we are using [standard-version](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version).

Steps:

1. When PRs/commits land to your master branch, select the Squash and Merge option.
2. Add a title and body that follows the [Conventional Commits Specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org).
3. Run `$ git checkout master; git pull origin master`
4. Run `$ npm run release`
5. Run `$ git push --follow-tags origin master && npm publish`

## Tests

### Unit Tests

There is a small set of tests implemented using Jest, to run them use: `$ npm test`

### Integration Tests

To test `adviser` running with built-in rules, run `$ npm run adviser` on the directory `__tests__/integration`

#### External Plugins

To use plugins and rules you can install one of the plugins created by the same team that created adviser:
